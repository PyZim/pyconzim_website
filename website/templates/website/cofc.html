    <h1>CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
<p>
PyCon Zimbabwe aims to be a welcoming event, where people meet in a friendly environment. Accordingly, all
participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the conference.
To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any
PyCon Zimbabwe event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code
before and throughout the event.</p>
<h2>IN SHORT</h2>
<p>PyCon Zimbabwe is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
    gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
    religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
    We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
<p>
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Don’t publish individual
    photographs of people without their consent. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are
    not appropriate for PyCon Zimbabwe.
Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the
    discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<h2>LONGER VERSION</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
    orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
    images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
    sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to
    those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon Zimbabwe.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
    including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
